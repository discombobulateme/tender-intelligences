    <h3>How machines discriminate</h3>
    <p class="fichatecnica">Video, 2020</p>
    <p>
      Machine learning systems have long been ubiquitous in our everyday lives.
      Human decisions are increasingly being outsourced to supposedly
      intelligent machines in order to simplify work processes and make them
      more efficient. These machines not only recognize faces, they also sort
      job applications, influence court cases, determine who should get a loan,
      decide on police operations and control border crossings. And it is
      becoming increasingly apparent that they are making racist, sexist or
      other discriminatory decisions in the process.

      In this video, Alice and Maxi explore what exactly lies behind these
      algorithmic decision-making systems, for example, what emotion recognition
      reads from the faces of black basketball players, what facial recognition
      has to do with front doors, and why appearance can influence
      advertisements.
