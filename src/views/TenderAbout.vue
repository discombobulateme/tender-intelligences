      “tender intelligences” is an exhibition on the use, design and care of
      community-driven AI. The intention of the curatorial approach hopes to
      inspire other communities around the globe to be co-creators of this
      technology that will likely impact their lives.

      Seeking to create dialogues between projects that critically use and/or
      design artificial intelligence as a powerful, inclusive, community-driven
      technology, the selection of projects is based on a few guiding
      provocations: which community(ies) have a key role? How are they dealing
      with AI? What is their outcome and impact for the community itself and
      beyond?
