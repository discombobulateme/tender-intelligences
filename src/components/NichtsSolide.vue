    <h3>Nichts als Solide (Nothing but Solid)</h3>
    <p class="fichatecnica">Video, 2021</p>
    <p>
      The room installation "Nichts als Solide" can be understood as an
      examination of those traces that people leave in their surroundings and
      that are burned into landscapes and places. In conversation with poems by
      the Jewish poet Mascha Kal√©ko and the Afro-German poet May Ayim, which
      serve as a data set for an artificial intelligence, a monologue emerges in
      which a new, fictional lyric self is formed. Through the medium of this
      virtual being, the artist not only asks questions about identity, but also
      answers them with self-empowerment by constructing a text with the
      statements generated by the AI and her own words in a context that gives
      rise to a decided stance.
