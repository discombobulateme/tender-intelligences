    <h3>Queer Feminist AI</h3>
    <p class="fichatecnica">AR Face Filter, 2022</p>
    <p>
      Queer Feminist AI - a game character from the latest project by BBB_, the
      "Songs of Cyborgeoisie", is intimidating and strong, soft-tempered and
      steel-bodied Artificial General Intelligence - an uncanny,
      techno-futuristic humanoid robot, indistinguishably intellectually
      intelligent, but still controllable, hardwired vessel for digital soul
      with a capacity to feel, dream and master unbound creativity. The
      face-filter "Queer Feminist AI" is an opportunity to transpose, a
      performative social media element, which could entertain, but foremost
      foster a non-linear conversation on what are all the things that
      artificial intelligence technology is, and of what it is not.
