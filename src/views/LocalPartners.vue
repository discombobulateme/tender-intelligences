      Our curatorial work was only possible through a close collaboration with
      two initiatives born in both cities: Poieto + Feminist.AI(Los Angeles) and
      Dreaming Beyond AI(Berlin). They both showcase AI-related projects that
      are community driven, which made them instrumental in our curatorial
      research.

      Dreaming Beyond AI is a space for critical and constructive knowledge,
      visionary fiction & speculative art and community-organising. Dreaming
      Beyond AI's concept was birthed by Nushin Yazdani and Buse Çetin, but
      influenced and inspired by the works, thoughts, tireless love, care, and
      tenacity of many incredible feminist voices.

      Poieto + Feminist.AI works to put technology into the hands of makers,
      researchers, thinkers and learners to amplify unheard voices and create
      more accessible AI for all. Poieto™ is a tool that provides
      community-derived social considerations of systems, data and models to
      provide more thoughtful AI design.
