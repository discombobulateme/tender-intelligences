    <h3>BBB_ Songs of Cyborgeoisie</h3>
    <p class="fichatecnica">
      Live hybrid performance, a computer game and a music album, 2022
    </p>
    <p>
      BBB_ Songs of Cyborgeoisie is a speculation about a queer evolutionary
      scenario of technologies, people, flora and fauna on Earth. It narrates
      about our world in the near future and enables a journey through feelings,
      fears and hopes of the worlds beings.

    <br />
    <p>
      Along with other inhabitants of the Robear Rehab - a rehabilitation center
      in a fantasy Universe of Cyborgeoisie - the AI character shares trauma of
      their feminine antagonist status quo in pop-cultural narratives on digital
      technology and its prescribed role in technological futures.

    <p>
      While AGI is idolized and fetishised, injured or murdered, subordinated
      and generally dramatised, varieties of artificial intelligence
      technologies infiltrate all spheres of life, reinforce human bias, and
      thus foster automated inequality in the present, making non-dystopian
      futures impossible to imagine. What kind of narratives do we need to shift
      and alter pop-cultural understanding of the artificial intelligences? How
      can such stories be accessible to a wider audience, but still down to
      earth and unsimplified?

      BBB_ (allapopp & Alex Sahm) is a technologically advanced
      cross-disciplinary project, which works on the intersection of music,
      performance, art, design and contemporary philosophy. Through experimental
      electronic music, spoken word and immersive setups, BBB_ seeks ambivalent
      situations taking place at the interface of the human and the inhuman
      existence and speculates on various states of mind, relationships and
      self-perception, altered by socially and emotionally intelligent digital
      technologies.
