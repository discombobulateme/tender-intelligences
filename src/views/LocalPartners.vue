      Our curatorial work was only possible through a close collaboration with
      two initiatives born in both cities:

        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >Dreaming Beyond AI</a
      >(Berlin). They both showcase AI-related projects that are community
      driven, which made them instrumental in our curatorial research.

      <span></span> Dreaming Beyond AI is a space for critical and constructive
      knowledge, visionary fiction & speculative art and community-organising.
      Dreaming Beyond AI's concept was birthed by Nushin Yazdani and Buse Çetin,
      but influenced and inspired by the works, thoughts, tireless love, care,
      and tenacity of many incredible feminist voices.

      Feminist.AI puts technology into the hands of more makers, researchers,
      thinkers, and learners by amplifying unheard voices that, in turn, make AI
      accessible for all. We actively imagine and secure spaces for
      intergenerational BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ womxn and non-binary folks gather to
      build unimagined tech together that is directly an expression of our
      cultures, stories, identities, and experiences. We want tech to be unique
      as ourselves.

      Poieto + Feminist.AI works to put technology into the hands of makers,
      researchers, thinkers and learners to amplify unheard voices and create
      more accessible AI for all. Poieto™ is a tool that provides
      community-derived social considerations of systems, data and models to
      provide more thoughtful AI design.
