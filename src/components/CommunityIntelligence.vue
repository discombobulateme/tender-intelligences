  <h3>Community of Intelligence</h3>
  <p class="fichatecnica">Sound installation, 2021</p>
  <p>
    A community of intelligence and the intelligence of community. A meditation
    to become aware of all the communities that are sustained by the earth.
    Living and non-living: Bacteria, fungus, virus, algae, plants, insects, sea
    animals, land animals, birds, humans, machines, stones, rivers, mountains,
    volcanoes, seas and oceans…maybe some extra-terrestrial life forms benefit
    from the bounty of our planet … we are one of many communities doing their
    best to survive, to thrive, seeking to find their place in the world.
