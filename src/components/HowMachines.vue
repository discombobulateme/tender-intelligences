  <h3>BBB_ Songs of Cyborgeoisie</h3>
  <p>
    BBB_ Songs of Cyborgeoisie is a speculation about a queer evolutionary
    scenario of technologies, people, flora and fauna on Earth. It narrates
    about our world in the near future and enables a journey through feelings,
    fears and hopes of the worlds beings.

    Along with other inhabitants of the Robear Rehab - a rehabilitation center
    in a fantasy Universe of Cyborgeoisie - the AI character shares trauma of
    their feminine antagonist status quo in pop-cultural narratives on digital
    technology and its prescribed role in technological futures.

    While AGI is idolized and fetishised, injured or murdered, subordinated and
    generally dramatised, varieties of artificial intelligence technologies
    infiltrate all spheres of life, reinforce human bias, and thus foster
    automated inequality in the present, making non-dystopian futures impossible
    to imagine. What kind of narratives do we need to shift and alter
    pop-cultural understanding of the artificial intelligences? How can such
    stories be accessible to a wider audience, but still down to earth and
    unsimplified?
