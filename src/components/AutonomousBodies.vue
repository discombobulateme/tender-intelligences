    <h3>Autonomous Bodies</h3>
    <p class="fichatecnica">
      Interactive physical installation, 2021 - current
    </p>
    <p>
      Autonomous Bodies is an interactive installation that explores the
      relationship between legislation, geography, safety, and bodily autonomy.
      U.S. states and many countries increasingly propose and pass laws that
      either affirm or encroach upon the bodily autonomy of many groups, from
      people who can become pregnant, to LGBTQ+ folks, to immigrants, to the
      incarcerated, to unhoused people, to the rights of bodies of land and
      water. This legislation is creating a national and global patchwork in
      which rights to bodily autonomy and safety vary state by state, and
      country by country, with historically marginalized groups and
      intersections of those groups disproportionately affected. At the same
      time, digital technologies, like telehealth, are complicating the
      geographic reach of such legislation, and might offer a means of claiming
      and reclaiming rights to bodily autonomy and, thus, to more safety.

    <h4>Feminist AI</h4>
    <p>
      Feminist.AI puts technology into the hands of more makers, researchers,
      thinkers, and learners by amplifying unheard voices that, in turn, make AI
      accessible for all. We actively imagine and secure spaces for
      intergenerational BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ womxn and non-binary folks gather to
      build unimagined tech together that is directly an expression of our
      cultures, stories, identities, and experiences. We want tech to be unique
      as ourselves.
