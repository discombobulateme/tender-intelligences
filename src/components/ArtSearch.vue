    <p>
      Framing our newest digital capabilities as artifacts on a continuum of
      technological development, ML and facial recognition were reimagined as
      archeological tools used to uncover uncanny likenesses over a timeline
      from 1964 to the present. The object is an interactive film generated
      using Machine Learning (ML). The project calls attention to multiple entry
      points of bias in the development of the search result, from
      representational biases in the production and sourcing of footage to the
      biases embedded in facial recognition model development and training
      (Buolamwini and Gebru 2018). The work is intentionally at odds with a
      linear narrative of progress, showing how each technological layer both
      illuminates and obscures our experience of information.
