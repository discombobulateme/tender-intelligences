      Research project and mobile application, 2018 - current
    </p>
    <p>
      Contextual Normalcy is a participatory AI research project in which
      machine learning (ML) and crowd-sourced data are used to create
      alternative visions of normalcy in feeling, mental health, and wellbeing.
      As we transition through stages of a global pandemic, how might we
      understand and process collective feelings? What patterns or experiences
      reflect this time, and how can we communicate them? In our project’s
      latest iteration, we turn to sound to explore these questions because of
      its intimate connections to time, space, and place-making. Our project
      will use ML, data tagging, and user-contributed stories to explore the
      ‘sound feeling’ across places in a shared time of distance.

      poieto is a tool, platform, and modular methodology that enables
      communities and individuals to co-create their technological futures. We
      believe that social considerations should be built into the design and
      development process, and that the making of technologies should be
      understood by and accessible to all. Through our tool, we aim to cultivate
      belonging, trust, understanding, and accountability in tech to produce
      more thoughtful, transparent, and equitable products and experiences.
