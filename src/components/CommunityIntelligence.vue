    <h3>Community of Intelligence</h3>
    <p class="fichatecnica">Sound installation, 2021</p>
    <p>
      A community of intelligence and the intelligence of community. A
      meditation to become aware of all the communities that are sustained by
      the earth. Living and non-living: Bacteria, fungus, virus, algae, plants,
      insects, sea animals, land animals, birds, humans, machines, stones,
      rivers, mountains, volcanoes, seas and oceans…maybe some extra-terrestrial
      life forms benefit from the bounty of our planet … we are one of many
      communities doing their best to survive, to thrive, seeking to find their
      place in the world.

      Tabita Rezaire is infinity incarnated into an agent of healing, who uses
      art as a mean to unfold the soul. Her cross-dimensional practices envision
      network sciences - organic, electronic and spiritual - as healing
      technologies to serve the shift towards heart consciousness.
      <br />
      Navigating digital, corporeal and ancestral memory as sites of struggles,
      she digs into scientific imaginaries to tackle the pervasive matrix of
      coloniality and the protocols of energetic misalignments that affect the
      songs of our body-mind-spirits. Inspired by quantum and cosmic mechanics,
      Tabita’s work is rooted in time-spaces where technology and spirituality
      intersect as fertile ground to nourish visions of connection and
      emancipation.
      <br />
      Through screen interfaces and collective offerings, her digital healing
      and energy streams remind us to access our own inner data center, to
      bypass western authority and download directly from source.
      <br />
      Tabita is based in Cayenne, French Guyana. She has a Bachelor in Economics
      (Fr) and a Master of Research in Artist Moving Image from Central Saint
      Martins (Uk). Tabita is a founding member of the artist group NTU, half of
      the duo Malaxa, and the mother of the energy house SENEB.
